# TAXI-EDA
INTRODUCTION 
Exploratory analysis of a taxi dataset involves examining the data to gain insights and uncover patterns or trends that can be used to improve taxi services. This analysis typically involves studying various attributes of the dataset and visualizing them through graphs or charts.

By analyzing the taxi dataset, we can extract valuable information such as peak hours of demand, popular pick-up and drop-off locations, average trip duration, fare distribution, and more. These insights can be used to optimize taxi operations, improve service efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
