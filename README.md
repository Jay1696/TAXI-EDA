# Taxi Trip Dataset Exploratory Analysis

This GitHub repository contains code for the exploratory analysis and visualization of the taxi trip dataset. The project aims to gain insights from the dataset and improve taxi services based on the findings. The analysis and visualization are performed using various libraries in Python.

## Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of a taxi trip dataset. The dataset used is the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data, consisting of 1,458,644 rows and 11 columns. The dataset includes attributes such as trip duration, pickup and dropoff locations, passenger count, and more. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the dataset to improve taxi services.

## Importing Required Libraries
The necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization are imported, including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, folium, and scikit-learn. These libraries provide the functionality needed to manipulate and visualize the dataset.

## Reading the Data
The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv()` function. The shape of the dataset is displayed, which shows the number of rows and columns. Additionally, any missing or null values in the dataset are checked using the `isnull().sum()` function.

## Data Visualization
The dataset is visualized using various plots and charts to understand the distribution and relationships between different attributes. The following visualizations are performed:

- Bar chart: Shows the count of trips for each month.
- Density plot: Displays the distribution of trip duration.
- Heat Maps: Visualizes the pickup and dropoff locations using heat maps.
- Line chart: Represents the distribution of pickups over time.
- Scatter plot: Shows the relationship between trip distance and duration.

## Insights and Analysis
The visualizations provide insights into the dataset, including:

- Most common pickup and dropoff locations
- Distribution of trip duration and distance
- Peak pickup and dropoff hours
- Average trip duration based on pickup day of the week
- Neighbourhood clustering using K-means algorithm

## Conclusion
Through the exploratory analysis and visualization of the taxi trip dataset, valuable insights and patterns have been identified. These findings can be used to enhance taxi services, improve efficiency, and optimize routes. This project serves as a foundation for further analysis and improvement in the taxi industry.
